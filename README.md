# Sorting_Visualizer

This website displays clearly the exact steps which takes place while sorting an array using various algorithms Like::

1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Website features::
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  * Blue:default
  * Yellow: Being compared
  * Red: Identified as positioned at incorrect place and to be moved
  * Green: Positioned correctly
2) Controlling the visualizer
  1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  2) Data size ()
  3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
3) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized. Time complexity of best average and worst cases are displayed
